# Capstone Project Intro

This is my Udacity Cloud DevOps Capstone project. In this project I created a CI/CD pipeline for a basic website which will be deployed to a cluster in AWS Kops via Vagrant & Ansible

## Prerequisites

To be able to use this CI/CD pipeline we will need:
- Jenkins
- kops
- Ansible
- Vagrant

To install Jenkins please follow this guide http://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/.
To install Vagrant please follow this guide https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.

### 1. Create AWS Cops cluster using Ansible

You can follow **ReadMe** file in **Vagrant-Kops-Ansible** Directory To Install AWS Kops Cluster Using Vagrant and Ansible.

### 2. Set up Jenkins EC2 Instace.

I Launched an Ubuntu Instance in my local VMware setup to Install Jenkins, Added **BlueOcean** Plugin and **Kubernetes Continuous Deploy** Plugin and **My Docker Hub** Credentials and **kubeconfig** Credentials.

### 3. Build Pipeline

Build my simple code of NGINX web page, Lint it, use the Aqua SecurityScanner to scan the code, build the html artifcat and upload it to AWS Kubernetes Cluster which was set up by KOPS via Vagrant & Ansible

### 3. Deploy Blue/Green pipelines

Deploy the web app to blue deployment instances then to the green one
